#At the top, weâ€™re importing
#the class models and then creating
# a subclass of models.Model Like any typical blog
#each blog post will have a title, slug, author name, and
# the timestamp or date when the article was published or last updated.
#Notice how we declared a tuple for STATUS of a post to keep draft and
#published posts separated when we render them out with templates.

#The Meta class inside the model contains metadata.
# We tell Django to sort results in the created_on field in descending order
# by default when we query the database.
#We specify descending order using the negative prefix.
#By doing so, posts published recently will appear first.
#The __str__() method is the default human-readable representation of the object.
#Django will use it in many places, such as the administration site.
